The Deadman and the Bogeygirl

One day a girl finds herself in a dark cave of a strange magical world. To return home and not get turned into a bogeyman she needs to find five magical keys and solve various puzzles with the help from an unlikely ally â€” the undead skeleton inhabiting this place.

My first game ever, as well as my first big project. It consists of 7 minigames united by a bizarre but funny storyline.
